    console.log(players, team)
    // same!
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team)
    // same! but...we updated the original array. references back to the original with updates instead of treating it as a copy

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team[3] = 'hee haww'
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99;

    // number has been updated
    console.log(person, captain)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    }

    // (arg1: blank object, arg2: fold in properties from object, arg3: fold in our own properties)
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(person2, capt2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(cap3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
